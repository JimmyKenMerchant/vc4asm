    <h1>Addendum to the <a href="http://www.broadcom.com/docs/support/videocore/VideoCoreIV-AG100-R.pdf">Broadcom
        VideoCore IV documentation</a></h1>
    <h2>Additional features</h2>
    <h3>Table 35: VCD DMA Write (VDW) Stride Setup Format</h3>
    <p>Unlike the documentation suggests the <tt>STRIDE</tt> field is 16 bits
      wide. Probably just a typo.</p>
    <h2>Instruction constraints</h2>
    <h3>No conditional write to <tt>t0s</tt>, <tt>t1s</tt></h3>
    <p>A write to the TMU retiring register (TMU0_S, TMU1_S) must not use
      conditional write access. Although the conditional write itself works the
      TMU fifo is triggered unconditional to process the request with undefined
      data in case the condition is not true.</p>
    <p>vc4asm warns about this kind of access.</p>
    <h3>Distance of branch instructions</h3>
    <p>There must be at least two non branch instructions between every two
      branch instructions. Otherwise no branch is taken or the thread will
      crash. This also applies if the branch conditions are reverse and only one
      of the branches can actually be taken.</p>
    <p>However, you can enqueue the next branch just before the last one is
      taken. Example:</p>
    <pre># r0 contains semaphore number [0..15]<br>mul24 ra31, r0, 3*8<br>nop<br>brr ra31, ra31, r:sacq<br>nop<br>nop<br>bra -, ra31<br>...<br><br>:sacq<br>.rep i, 16<br>nop<br>nop<br>sacq -, i<br>.endr</pre>
    <p>The above code fragment dynamically acquires a semaphore depending on the
      number in the r0 register. This is the shortest possible code fragment to
      do this task.</p>
    <h3>MUL ALU pack modes and I/O register targets</h3>
    <p>The MUL ALU pack modes that write only a single byte are not available
      for I/O register targets, i.e. <tt>waddr_mul</tt> &ge; 32. The write only
      hardware registers cannot write slices of a word.</p>
